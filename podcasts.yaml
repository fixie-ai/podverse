      Any society that allows itself to become radically unequal eventually
      collapses into an uprising or a police stateâ€”or both. Join venture
      capitalist Nick Hanauer and some of the worldâ€™s leading economic and
      political thinkers in an exploration of who gets what and why. Turns out,
      everything you learned about economics is wrong. And if we donâ€™t do
      something about rising inequality, the pitchforks are coming.
